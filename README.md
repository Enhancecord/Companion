# EquicordCompanion

Equicord Companion is a vscode extension to test Equicord patches & webpack finds right from the comfort of your IDE

- Adds "Test Find" on any webpack finds that will test whether your filter finds exactly one module (and not more or none)

- Adds "Test Patch" on any patches you define in definePlugin() that will test that your find is unique and your match and replace works and compiles correctly

- Adds "View Module" on any patches you define in definePlugin() that will show you the module you are trying to patch

- Adds "Diff Module" on any patches you define in definePlugin() that will show you the module unpatched & patched

To use it you also need to be using Equicord and enable the  "DevCompanion" plugin. Then just start Discord

For custom building the companion you need the vsix. We recommend the marketplace link below.
